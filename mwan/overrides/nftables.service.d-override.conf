# Stock nftables has Before=network-pre.target - firewall must load BEFORE
# networking. Do NOT add After=network-online.target here as it creates a
# cycle: nftables → network-pre → networkd → network → network-online → nftables

# NPT rules are applied later by mwan-update-npt.service (after DHCPv6-PD).

[Service]
# Allow nftables to start even if some interfaces are DOWN
# Rules will simply not match until interfaces come up

// Recovery from a snapshot cycle that fails partway.
//
// Proxmox takes a configuration lock on the guest for the whole of a
// snapshot, a snapshot delete, or a rollback, and releases it in a final
// block that runs only when every step succeeded. A delete that the
// storage layer rejects skips that block, so the lock and the half-removed
// snapshot entry both survive the failure and every later operation on the
// guest is refused, including the deploy playbook's own snapshot.
//
// The snapshot cycle repeats on each probe, so without the pacing below a
// failure that cannot resolve itself is retried every few seconds for as
// long as it lasts.

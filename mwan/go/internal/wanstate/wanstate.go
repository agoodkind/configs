// serves. Modules write a snapshot of what they just reconciled; the
// operational-datastore provider reads it at request time. The store is
// the seam between the two: writers never wait on a reader, readers
// never touch a reconcile lock, and a reader always sees a complete
// snapshot from some recent pass rather than a half-written one.

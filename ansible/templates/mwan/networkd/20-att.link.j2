# AT&T WAN Interface (X710 VF passthrough - iavf driver)
# Generated by Ansible
# Matches on iavf driver, assigns name eth1 and spoofs MAC for AT&T auth
# This interface is so that WPA can be run
# Once authenticated, AT&T will immediately put traffic on to vlan03242
# therefore we do not need an att network file, only the att vlan 3242 file

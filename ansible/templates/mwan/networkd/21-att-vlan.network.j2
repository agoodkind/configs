# AT&T assigns a IPv4 address & gateway via DHCP
# and then the static IPv4s we were given can be routed through it.

# AT&T Assigns a /60 prefix via DHCPv6-PD

# Note on Routing Policy:
# Unlike the Webpass interface (which has static IPs), this AT&T interface
# obtains its IP and Gateway dynamically via DHCP/RA.
#
# We CANNOT define static [Route] or [RoutingPolicyRule] sections here because
# we don't know the Gateway or Source IP at template time.
#
# Instead, we rely on the networkd-dispatcher script (50-update-routes.sh) to:
# 1. Detect the dynamic Gateway/IP after the link comes up.
# 2. Add the default route to table {{ mwan_rt_tables.att }}.
# 3. Add the ip rules (fwmark/from) for policy routing.

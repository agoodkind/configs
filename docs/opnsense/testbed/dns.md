# Testbed DNS and NAT64

How name resolution works on the suburban testbed, and how to recover it when a
rebuilt testbed OPNsense comes up with DNS broken. The testbed is IPv6 primary:
its simulated ISPs carry IPv4 transit only and no public IPv6, so IPv6-only
guests reach the IPv4 internet through NAT64 plus DNS64. The config owns the
live definitions; this page carries the behavior and the recovery steps.

## Components

Three pieces cooperate, and each one's exact values live with the config that
owns them.

Tayga translates between the two families on the testbed OPNsense through the
`os-tayga` plugin. Its prefix and pool come from the `<tayga>` block of the
imported router config, where the transform rewrites production's prefix to the
testbed's.

The `dns64.suburban.goodkind.io` LXC runs bind9 and synthesizes AAAA records
into that prefix, so an IPv4-only name resolves to an address Tayga can
translate. Its address, resolver, and synthesis settings are group vars; deploy
them with
`go run goodkind.io/configs/cmd/configs deploy deploy-dns64 --limit dns64_suburban_servers`.
It forwards to the testbed OPNsense's Unbound over native IPv6, so its own
recursion does not ride the Tayga path.

Unbound on the testbed OPNsense answers for the LAN and is configured from the
imported router config.

Synthesis applies only to names that lack a real AAAA. A dual-stack name keeps
its native address and reaches it over native IPv6, which is what the testbed is
meant to exercise.

## Recovering DNS on a rebuilt testbed OPNsense

A freshly imported testbed OPNsense (host key changes, so use diagnostics-only
relaxed host checking) tends to come up with DNS down for these reasons, in the
order you hit them.

1. **Unbound will not start because the python DNSBL module file is missing.**
   The prod config import leaves Unbound configured with `module-config: "python
   validator iterator"` and `python-script: unbound-dnsbl/dnsbl_module.py`, but
   the rebuilt box has no `dnsbl_module.py`, so Unbound exits at init with
   `fatal error: bad config during init for python module`. DNSBL is
   `<enabled>0</enabled>` in the config yet the python wrapper still renders on
   26.1. Recover by regenerating the module and clearing the stale pid:

   ```sh
   configctl unbound dnsbl       # regenerates /var/unbound/unbound-dnsbl/dnsbl_module.py
   service unbound onestop       # clears the stale pidfile from the crashed start
   service unbound onestart
   ```

2. **Tayga daemon is down.** The `nat64` tun interface and the `2664::/96` route
   can persist while the translator is not running. There is no `rc.d/tayga`
   script (the plugin uses `opnsense-tayga` via configd), so start it with:

   ```sh
   configctl tayga start
   ```

   Verify translation from the OPNsense with `ping6 3d06:bad:b01:2664::1.1.1.1`.

3. **The DNS64 LXC may be stopped.** From the suburban hypervisor, check it
   with `pct status <dns64-vmid>` (the id is in the service inventory), start
   it with `pct start`, and confirm `named` runs inside it.

Diagnostic note: `sockstat` and `pgrep` need `sudo` on the OPNsense to show the
root-owned Unbound and Tayga; without it they falsely report nothing on `:53`.

## How the testbed MWAN VM reaches DNS

The testbed MWAN VM's management interface sits on the VMNET services segment,
the same segment as the testbed OPNsense VMNET interface and the DNS64 LXC.
This mirrors production, where the MWAN VM's management interface shares the
OPNsense LAN `/64` and reaches DNS on-link. The MWAN group vars point
`mwan_dns_servers` at the on-link OPNsense Unbound, so the VM resolves A
records there and reaches them over its IPv4 WAN. The OPNsense Unbound does
not synthesize DNS64; that path is for the IPv6-only LAN guests that point at
the DNS64 LXC instead.

After a daemon deploy, the OPNsense deploy restarts Tayga
(`configctl tayga restart`) and regenerates the Unbound DNSBL python module
before restarting Unbound (`configctl unbound dnsbl` then
`configctl unbound restart`), on prod and testbed. OPNsense core always renders
`python-script: unbound-dnsbl/dnsbl_module.py` into `unbound.conf` even with
DNSBL disabled, so a freshly imported box crashed Unbound at startup until the
module file existed; the deploy now creates it, and the Tayga restart re-installs
NAT64 routes after a WAN outage or import. Neither needs a manual recovery step.

## Reproducibility gaps

These still need to move from manual recovery into the deploy path:

- The config transform rewrites the prod Unbound forwarder
  (`3d06:bad:b01:200::53`) to a public resolver (`2606:4700:4700::1111`). On the
  IPv6-only testbed that target is only reachable through NAT64, so forwarding
  still depends on the testbed having working upstream transit; a rebuilt
  OPNsense that has not converged BGP/DNS yet returns no answers until it does.

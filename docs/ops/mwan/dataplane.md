# MWAN data plane

Three `mwan ifmgr` modules in the `mwan-ifmgr@wan` unit converge the data
plane independently of the BGP speaker: `wan.routes` owns `ip rule` and the
per-WAN routing tables, `health` owns the WAN health verdicts and state
files, and `npt` owns the runtime `table ip6 nat`. A health transition
requests an immediate reconcile in-process, so a failed WAN reroutes without
waiting for a periodic tick.

## Shared per-WAN foundation

`wan.routes` and `npt` run in the `wan` role and read one WAN list from the
gateway's network configuration, which the daemon loads from
`/etc/mwan/network.json` and validates against the model before it programs
anything. Each WAN entry hangs off the interface that carries it and holds that
WAN's full config: its name plus the policy-routing slots `wan.routes` programs
(table, fwmark, priorities, prefixes). The internal prefix and edge addresses
both modules translate against are group-wide values in the same file. Each
module reads the fields it needs from that one per-WAN entry, so each WAN has a
single home instead of a per-module list matched by name.

## wan.routes ifmgr module

The `wan.routes` module owns policy routing. It watches each WAN interface
over netlink and reconciles the per-WAN tables and the `ip rule` set on every
default-route change plus a periodic tick, so it does not miss a late
RA-learned default route. It owns priorities 50/55/56/57/100/200/300. Its
fwmark rules share a priority with the networkd from-edge rules without
thrash.

## npt ifmgr module

The `npt` module owns the runtime `table ip6 nat`. It runs as a second module
in the `mwan-ifmgr@wan` instance alongside `wan.routes` and self-disables when
the network configuration lists no WANs.

npt derives every WAN's `/60` from the live DHCPv6-PD delegation on that WAN's
interface, with no static fallback. A WAN with no delegated prefix is skipped for
that reconcile, rather than translated against a guessed prefix.

npt alerts on a missing delegation only when the network configuration assigns
that provider a translation prefix, and clears the alert once the delegation
returns. A provider the configuration assigns no prefix is never expected to
carry one, because its link is IPv4-only or its ISP delegates nothing by
DHCPv6-PD, so npt raises nothing for it. That keeps the alert meaningful for the
case it exists to catch: a provider that should hold a delegation and lost it.

npt owns the `prerouting` and `postrouting` chains and replaces each chain's
full rule set in one atomic `google/nftables` transaction, so no packet sees an
empty chain mid-update and no reconcile can leave a duplicate rule. An nft
watcher requests a reconcile when the `ip6 nat` table changes underneath the
module, so an external `nftables` reload converges back within one pass.

npt does not tear its rules down when the module stops. A binary swap or an
`mwan-ifmgr@wan` restart leaves the kernel forwarding on the last-applied rules,
and the next reconcile after restart re-applies them atomically. Forwarding never
stops, and no swap leaves a chain empty or double-programmed.

## Health state and the email guard

The `health` module writes one state file, `/var/run/mwan-health.state`. The
`wan.routes` and `steering` modules and `--status` consumers read it, and every
verdict change rewrites it atomically.

Every daemon start puts each configured provider at `unknown` and probes it from
scratch, so a verdict rests on the probes of the run that reports it. No file
records a verdict across a restart.

The warmup state decides the first email after a restart. A provider that comes
back healthy transitions `unknown -> healthy`, which has no earlier alert to
resolve and sends nothing. A provider that is broken at startup transitions
`unknown -> unhealthy` and raises its alert immediately, rather than staying
silent until it has been healthy once.

Failure modes worth knowing:

- **Empty `table ip6 nat`** means runtime programming did not happen or was
  flushed. The npt module's nft watcher reconverges it within one reconcile;
  `systemctl restart mwan-ifmgr@wan` forces the pass immediately.
- **Boot ordering**: PCI/virtio devices and AT&T 802.1X authentication can be
  late. The ifmgr modules replay on netlink events and periodic ticks, so a
  late device converges without a dispatcher-style one-shot race.

For terminology, prefer **healthy / unhealthy / unknown** for WAN state. Avoid
**up / down** for health, because that conflicts with `ip link` administrative
state.

## Tracing

The ifmgr daemon emits structured JSON logs to `/var/log/mwan-ifmgr.jsonl`,
and each line carries the active `traceId` so events across a deploy or a
boot correlate. `update-att-pinned-dests.sh` still writes shell-side JSON to
`/var/log/mwan-debug.log` when `mwan_debug_logging: true`.

Trace ID sources:

- `mwan-trace-boot.service` writes `/run/mwan-trace-id` and
  `/var/lib/mwan/trace-id` at boot.
- The deploy playbook writes the same files at the start of deploy.

Quick check on MWAN:

```bash
cat /run/mwan-trace-id
mwan debug trace-tail
```

On MWAN:

```bash
ssh root@mwan.home.goodkind.io
wpa_cli status
systemctl status wpa_supplicant-mwan systemd-networkd networkd-dispatcher \
  nftables mwan-ifmgr@wan cloudflared
mwan debug npt              # native inspection: prefixes|routes|policy|status|stats|sim4|sim6|npt

mwan debug systemd          # failed/stuck units and slowest starters over D-Bus
mwan debug trace-tail       # follow the ifmgr daemon JSON log (/var/log/mwan-ifmgr.jsonl), filter by trace id
```

IPv6 sanity checks:

```bash
ip -6 route show table 100
ip -6 route show table 200
ip -6 rule show
nft -a list chain ip6 nat postrouting
nft -a list chain ip6 nat prerouting
```

# Networking and DHCP diagnosis

IPv6 connectivity is P0. Treat IPv6 issues as critical priority and diagnose the
IPv6 stack first, then IPv4. See [docs/infra/overview.md](overview.md) for the
current live network state and [docs/infra/access.md](access.md) for SSH paths
between hosts.

## Configuration preferences

- Prefer IPv6 literals over IPv4 in configuration files and bindings:
  `[::1]` rather than `127.0.0.1`, `[::]` rather than `0.0.0.0`.
- When verifying connectivity (SSH, curl, etc.), test the IPv6 address first.

## DHCPv6 reservation matching in KEA

### Root cause: DUID instability

Containers and VMs sometimes get a different IPv6 address than the
MAC-based reservation specifies. The usual cause is that the client's DUID
changes.

systemd-networkd generates DUIDs that can change:

- `DUIDType=vendor` (default) is derived from `/etc/machine-id` and changes when
  the container is recreated.
- `DUIDType=link-layer` is derived from the MAC and is stable if the MAC is
  pinned.
- `DUIDType=uuid` is derived from the product UUID and may change.

Two related problems compound the DUID issue:

- When DUID changes, KEA creates new leases but the old ones remain active and
  conflict with the new ones.
- Without `host-reservation-identifiers` matching the actual identifier used in
  reservations, KEA never prioritises MAC-based matching.

### KEA configuration principles

Three knobs control reservation matching.

`mac-sources` tells KEA how to extract a MAC address from DHCPv6 packets:

- `"duid"` extracts the MAC from a DUID-LL (format `00:03:00:01:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`).
- `"ipv6-link-local"` extracts the MAC from the EUI-64 link-local address.
- `"client-link-addr-option"` uses option 79 if provided by a relay agent.

`host-reservation-identifiers` controls which identifier types KEA checks and
in what order. The reservation's identifier must be in this list, otherwise it
will not match.

Per-reservation identifier types:

- `duid` matches the DUID directly and requires a stable DUID.
- `hw-address` matches the MAC and requires that MAC extraction works.

Decision tree:

1. Is the DUID stable for a given MAC?
   - DUID-LL: use `duid` in the reservation,
     `host-reservation-identifiers: ["duid", "hw-address"]`.
   - DUID changes: use `hw-address` in the reservation and make sure
     `mac-sources` can extract the MAC.
2. Can the MAC be extracted at all?
   - DUID-LL (`00:03:00:01:...`): `mac-sources: ["duid"]` works.
   - DUID-EN (`00:02:...`): `mac-sources: ["duid"]` does not work. Use
     `["ipv6-link-local"]` or `["client-link-addr-option"]`.
   - Other formats: typically need `["ipv6-link-local"]` or a relay agent.

### Required systemd-networkd configuration

```ini
[DHCPv6]
DUIDType=link-layer
```

This produces a DUID-LL of `00:03:00:01:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` where the last six
bytes are the MAC. DUID-LL is stable as long as the MAC is pinned. If the MAC
changes, the DUID changes.

## Diagnosis workflow

### 1. Inspect container or VM state

```bash
ssh root@<host> "ip -6 addr show eth0"
ssh root@<host> "networkctl status eth0 | grep -i duid"
ssh root@<host> "ip link show eth0 | grep -i link/ether"
```

### 2. Inspect KEA leases

```bash
ssh <kea-host> "sudo cat /var/db/kea/kea-leases6.csv | grep -i '<mac>'"
```

The [kea/Rakefile](../../kea/Rakefile) provides higher-level helpers, for
example `rake lease:get6_by_ip[<ip>]` and
`rake lease:cleanup6_by_mac[<mac>]`.

### 3. Identify DUID instability

Look for multiple different DUIDs for the same MAC:

- DUID-EN format `00:02:00:00:XX:XX:...` is machine-id based and unstable.
- DUID-LL format `00:03:00:01:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` is MAC based and stable.

### 4. Inspect KEA configuration

```bash
grep -A 2 "host-reservation-identifiers" /path/to/kea-dhcp6.conf
grep "mac-sources" /path/to/kea-dhcp6.conf
```

### 5. Clean up stale leases

By MAC, when DUID has changed:

```bash
cd /path/to/bind-kea
rake lease:cleanup6_by_mac[<mac>,<subnet_id>]
```

By DUID, when you have a specific DUID:

```bash
rake lease:cleanup6_conflicts[<duid>,<subnet_id>]
```

By IP, when the wrong IP is known:

```bash
rake lease:delete6_by_ip[<ip>]
```

### 6. Renew DHCP on the client

```bash
ssh root@<host> "systemctl restart systemd-networkd"
# or
ssh root@<host> "networkctl renew eth0"
```

### 7. Verify the reservation is honoured

```bash
ssh root@<host> "ip -6 addr show eth0 | grep 'scope global'"
ssh <kea-host> "sudo cat /var/db/kea/kea-leases6.csv | grep '<expected-ip>'"
```

## Common issues

### Container gets a different IP each time

1. Check DUID stability:

   ```bash
   ssh root@<host> "networkctl status eth0 | grep -i 'DUID:'"
   ssh <kea-host> "cat /var/db/kea/kea-leases6.csv | grep '<mac>' \
     | awk -F',' '{print $2}' | sort -u"
   ```

2. Identify the DUID format:
   - `00:02:...` is DUID-EN (machine-id based, unstable across recreations).
   - `00:03:00:01:...` is DUID-LL (MAC based, stable if the MAC is pinned).
   - `00:04:...` is DUID-UUID (may change).
3. Determine root cause:
   - DUID changes: check `DUIDType` in systemd-networkd config.
   - MAC changes: check Proxmox or VM config for MAC pinning.
   - Multiple DUIDs exist: stale leases from previous DUID formats.
4. Fix at the source: configure `DUIDType=link-layer`, pin the MAC in the
   hypervisor config, or clean up the conflicting leases.

### Reservation exists but is not honoured

1. Verify the reservation:

   ```bash
   grep -A 5 "reservations" /path/to/kea-dhcp6.conf
   grep "host-reservation-identifiers" /path/to/kea-dhcp6.conf
   ```

2. Check the client identifier:

   ```bash
   ssh root@<host> "networkctl status eth0 | grep -i 'DUID:'"
   ssh root@<host> "ip link show eth0 | grep -i link/ether"
   ```

3. Check active leases:

   ```bash
   ssh <kea-host> "cat /var/db/kea/kea-leases6.csv | grep '<mac-or-duid>'"
   ```

4. Identify the mismatch:
   - Reservation uses `hw-address` but the client sends DUID-EN, so no MAC is
     extractable.
   - Reservation uses `duid` but the DUID format changed.
   - Multiple active leases with different identifiers for the same MAC.
   - `host-reservation-identifiers` does not include the identifier type used.
5. Fix at the source: update the reservation or `host-reservation-identifiers`,
   clean up conflicting leases, or change `mac-sources`.

### Multiple active leases for the same MAC

Root cause: the DUID changed over time and created multiple lease entries.

```bash
rake lease:cleanup6_by_mac[<mac>,<subnet_id>]
```

## Last resort: hardcoded DUID

Only use when the root cause cannot be fixed. If a DUID continues to change
despite `DUIDType=link-layer`, you can hardcode it:

1. Read the current DUID:

   ```bash
   ssh root@<host> "networkctl status eth0 | grep -i 'DUID:'"
   ```

2. Extract the raw DUID without the type prefix. DUID-LL is
   `00:03:00:01:bc:24:11:1d:2c:0f` and the raw MAC-based portion is
   `bc:24:11:1d:2c:0f`.
3. Pin the value in systemd-networkd:

   ```ini
   [DHCPv6]
   DUIDType=link-layer
   DUIDRawData=bc:24:11:1d:2c:0f
   ```

4. Update the KEA reservation to use the DUID rather than the MAC.

This is a workaround. The proper fix is to ensure DUID stability through MAC
pinning and `DUIDType=link-layer`.

## IPv6 reachability through MWAN

### Webpass small-payload ICMPv6 drop

Webpass silently drops ICMPv6 echo requests with payload `<= 8` bytes, so
the BSD `ping6` default (8-byte payload) returns 100% loss even when the
path is healthy. Probe IPv6 from FreeBSD or macOS with `ping6 -s 16 ...`
instead. Linux `ping6` defaults to a 56-byte payload and is unaffected.

### MWAN dataplane state for the customer prefix

The internal `/60` block and the per-segment `/64` gateways in the diagnostics
below are the internal addressing plan (service hostnames and addresses in
[service_mapping.yml](../../ansible/inventory/group_vars/all/service_mapping.yml));
the provider PD is dynamic and read live by `find-pd-prefixes.sh`. Three pieces of
state on MWAN must be present for OPNsense LAN traffic to reach the public IPv6
internet:

- **Webpass PD lease.** `find-pd-prefixes.sh enwebpass0` returns the live
  `/56` delegated by Webpass (currently `2604:5500:c271:be00::/56`).
- **NPT rules** in `nft list table ip6 nat`. `update-npt.sh` programs them
  from the live PD lease. `mwan-update-npt.service` is the boot safety net.
- **Internal `/60` return route** in MWAN's main + tables 100/200/300:
  `3d06:bad:b01::/60 via fe80::be24:11ff:fe77:500c dev enmwanbr0`.
  `update-routes.sh` writes this. Without it, MWAN cannot forward conntrack
  replies for any non-shared LAN `/64` back to OPNsense.

### Source-sweep diagnostic

When only some IPv6 sources work, sweep across every routable `/64` from
OPNsense:

```bash
ssh router 'for src in 3d06:bad:b01::1 3d06:bad:b01:1::1 3d06:bad:b01:2::1 \
    3d06:bad:b01:a::1 3d06:bad:b01:10::1 3d06:bad:b01:64::1 \
    3d06:bad:b01:fe::2; do
        echo "=== source $src ==="
        ping6 -c 2 -s 16 -S "$src" 2606:4700:4700::1111
done'
```

Interpretation:

- All sources work: IPv6 path healthy.
- All sources fail: WAN side broken (Webpass, NPT, or upstream).
- Shared LAN `/64` (`3d06:bad:b01::1`) + transit `/64`
  (`3d06:bad:b01:fe::2`) work; everything else fails: MWAN is missing the
  internal `/60` return route. The shared `/64` reaches OPNsense without a
  route because OPNsense `vtnet0` and MWAN `enmgmt0` are L2 neighbors on
  that subnet.

### Verify and recover the internal /60 return route

On MWAN:

```bash
ip -6 route show table all | grep '3d06:bad:b01::/60'
```

Expected: one entry in main + one in each of tables 100, 200, 300.

If empty, recover with `systemctl start mwan-update-routes` to re-run
`update-routes.sh`. The script is idempotent.

The dispatcher hook `routable.d/50-update-routes.sh` fires
`update-routes.sh` on any routable transition for `enwebpass0`,
`enatt0.3242`, `enmbrains0`, or `enmwanbr0` (the internal link), so any
flap of those interfaces reinstalls the route automatically.

## Pre-commit checklist

1. Verify `host-reservation-identifiers: ["hw-address"]` (or the matching
   identifier list) in KEA config.
2. Verify `mac-sources` includes the right extraction method.
3. Verify `DUIDType=link-layer` in systemd-networkd config.
4. Verify the MAC address is pinned in Proxmox or VM config.
5. Check for stale leases before deploying changes.
6. Verify reservation matching after deployment.
